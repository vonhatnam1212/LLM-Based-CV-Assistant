Notable accomplishments include successfully managing customer debts and enhancing credit history at Tpbank, as well as providing insights on market trends and transportation services at N\u1ed9i B\u00e0i Company. My professional experience includes roles such as Business Project Officer at N\u1ed9i B\u00e0i Express Joint Stock Commercial Bank, where I engaged with businesses to align them with domestic logistics markets, offered appropriate transportation services, and resolved any issues that arose during the transportation process. At Alibaba.com, I guided businesses on export markets and managed their product listings on the platform. Moreover, my tenure at Tpbank as a Debt Collection Officer equipped me with the skills to effectively communicate with customers, analyze debt situations, and propose suitable solutions to improve credit histories. I also have experience in financial institutions like Bagang, where I handled customer debt resolution, data analysis, and customer acquisition. My expertise extends to the real estate industry as well, having worked at Tr\u1ea7n Anh Group as a Sales Executive, where I assisted clients in property investment decisions. Additionally, my academic background as a Hydrological Engineer from HUNRE has equipped me with specialized skills in data collection, analysis, observation, and planning. My soft skills include proficient presentation abilities, team collaboration, effective communication, and problem-solving. I am fluent in Vietnamese and have a conversational level of Chinese.

I also represented the company in litigation and enforcement proceedings while actively contributing to the development of procedures and regulations within the organization.\n\nPrior to this, I held the position of Team Leader in the Debt Processing Department at VIB International Bank, where I successfully managed a team of six specialists, overseeing their daily activities, and ensuring compliance with debt recovery targets set by the bank. I was instrumental in representing the bank in legal matters and collaborated with state authorities, in addition to playing a key role in recruitment and training initiatives to enhance the team's expertise.\n\nDuring my tenure at VPBank Prosperity Bank, I held roles as a Senior Specialist at the Business Debt Recovery Center and later led the unsecured legal execution team as Head. In these positions, I managed a team of ten specialists, focused on meeting debt recovery targets, and overseeing daily operations effectively.\n\nIn my academic pursuits, I have obtained Bachelor's degrees in Law and Business Administration from prestigious institutions, complementing my practical experience in the banking sector. Additionally, I have undertaken various training courses and certifications to further enhance my skills, including language proficiency and computer literacy.\n\nMy soft skills, including being sociable, cheerful, diligent, enthusiastic, reliable, responsible, and proactive, have enabled me to build strong relationships with colleagues and clients, contributing to a positive work environment. On the hard skills front, I excel in time management, customer information verification, debt resolution strategies, legal representation, collaboration with state authorities, recruitment and training, and the development of procedures and regulations.\n\nI am fluent in Vietnamese and English, with a strong foundation in Japanese, reflecting my commitment to expanding my language abilities.

My work experience includes roles as a Marketing Coordinator at XYZ Company, where I spearheaded marketing strategies, managed social media, coordinated events, and analyzed market trends. Additionally, as a Sales Associate at ABC Corporation, I excelled in assisting customers, processing transactions, maintaining store appearance, and achieving sales objectives. During my internship at the DEF Internship Program, I gained valuable hands-on experience across various departments such as marketing, sales, and operations. My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, a Master of Business Administration from Stanford University, and I am currently pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at Harvard University. I possess a comprehensive skill set that includes soft skills such as communication, teamwork, problem-solving, leadership, and time management, as well as hard skills in Python programming, Microsoft Excel, data analysis, project management, and financial modeling. Additionally, I am multilingual with fluency in English, conversational skills in Spanish, professional proficiency in French, advanced level in German, intermediate in Italian, and basic knowledge of Mandarin and Japanese. I hold certifications in Project Management Professional (PMP) from the Project Management Institute, Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) from Scrum Alliance, AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate from Amazon Web Services, and ITIL Foundation Certification from Axelos. My dedication to professional development is evident in my pursuit of certifications and ongoing commitment to enhancing my skills.", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "CV_74.pdf", "file_path": "/home/namvn/workspace/LLMs/VPbank_hackathon/LLM-Based-CV-Assistant/data/RB - Chuy\u00ean vi\u00ean cao c\u1ea5p Quan h\u1ec7 Kh\u00e1ch h\u00e0ng \u01b0u ti\u00ean_H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i - OPN 35095/CV/CV_74.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 169012, "creation_date": "2024-05-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-24"}}

My expertise lies in building energy-efficient models for sustainable and economically viable buildings, as well as effectively managing project teams. During my tenure, I excelled in tasks such as building work plans, assigning tasks, ensuring quality, supervising department activities, organizing specialized training programs, and participating in recruitment and reward processes.\n\nIn my previous role as an Energy Efficiency Consultant Engineer at Elithis Asia Company, I specialized in simulating building operations in terms of thermal-energy, calculating energy losses, energy consumption levels in buildings, and proposing optimal energy-saving solutions in materials and energy consumption systems within buildings. I also conducted research and recommended sound insulation solutions for construction projects, calculated carbon emissions levels of buildings, and proposed material usage options to achieve carbon neutrality goals. Furthermore, I have a strong academic background with a Bachelor's degree in International Business Administration from Foreign Trade University, a degree in polymer and composite material engineering from M\u1ecf Albi University, and a degree in Bridge Engineering from Hanoi University of Transport.\n\nMy soft skills include strong analytical and information synthesis abilities, along with project management expertise. In terms of hard skills, I am proficient in French and MS Office tools, particularly in creating internal tools in Excel. I am also skilled in thermal simulation software such as Climawin 2005, Climawin 2020, and IES VE, as well as familiar with thermal standards RT2005, RT2012, RE2020, and HQE standards. Additionally, I am experienced in using AutoCAD software.\n\nI hold certifications as a Head of Energy Efficiency Consulting Department and Energy Efficiency Consultant Engineer from Elithis Asia Company, demonstrating my expertise and dedication to the field. I am now seeking a challenging role in energy efficiency and sustainable construction where I can leverage my knowledge and skills to contribute to innovative and environmentally friendly building solutions.", "metadata": {"file_name": "CV_97.docx", "file_path": "/home/namvn/workspace/LLMs/VPbank_hackathon/LLM-Based-CV-Assistant/data/SME - Chuy\u00ean Vi\u00ean Quan H\u1ec7 Kh\u00e1ch H\u00e0ng Doanh Nghi\u1ec7p \u2013 Mi\u1ec1n B\u1eafc - OPN 38888/CV/CV_97.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 1924705, "creation_date": "2024-05-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-13"}}
